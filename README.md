# Fullstack Assessment
This project implements a fullstack web app where you can interact with eight numbered cards.
The time of the first click on the card and the number of clicks on each card is stored in a
PostgreSQL Database.
The first click of each card sets the timestamp in the database, and every click of a card
sets the number of clicks in the back end. Both of these variables are displayed in the frontend.
Additionally, the user can sort the cards based off of these variables, and they can clear the
card information, too.
The PostgreSQL database needs the following:
Username: postgre
Database: postgre
Password: password
port: 5432
The application can be ran using the docker-compose file in the project folder.

Challenges:
The frontend side of the project proved very easy, as it was similar to other projects I have
worked on in the past. I was relatively unfamiliar with React, but it was easy to get a grasp of.
The backend side of the project proved to be more challenging for me. I have worked on projects using
SQL databases before, but it had never been my priority, so I feel like I learned a lot being able to 
tackle this project independently. The server proved to be the most difficult part for me, but after
some troubleshooting, all of the errors were solved. Overall, if anything, I learned a lot from this
project, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on it.
